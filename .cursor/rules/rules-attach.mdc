# Cursor Rules Manifest

This file acts as an index for supplementary Cursor rules available in this project.

All rule files live in the `.cursor/rules/` directory at the project root.

Refer to the following documents as needed:

- `backend-architecture.mdc` – Guidelines for backend layer architecture and design.
- `zustand-action-patterns.mdc` – Recommended patterns for organizing Zustand actions.
- `zustand-slice-organization.mdc` – Best practices for structuring Zustand slices.
- `drizzle-schema-style-guide.mdc` – Style guide for defining Drizzle ORM schemas.
- `react-component.mdc` – React component style guide and conventions.

note: read above rules by `read_file` tool instead of `fetch_rules` tool.
